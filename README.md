# Project: Real-Time Gaze Tracking for Enhanced Student Engagement

## Overview
This repository is part of a collaborative project by Group 5 in the 18-799-RW Applied Computer Vision Course at CMU-Africa. Our project focuses on leveraging the DeepGaze III model to improve student engagement in educational settings through real-time gaze tracking.

## Repository Structure
- `Mathew_GESCAM__A_Dataset_and_Method_on_Gaze_Estimation_for_CVPRW_2024_paper`: This is our baseline paper.

## Project Objective
The goal is to implement DeepGaze III for real-time monitoring of student engagement using standard webcams, which are more accessible and cost-effective than traditional eye-tracking hardware. We aim to enhance teaching strategies by providing educators with real-time feedback on student attention levels.

## Committing Experiments
This repository will also serve as a record of all experiments conducted for the project. Regular updates will allow other group members and stakeholders to track progress and maintain transparency in our research process.

## Datasets
We are using a synthetic dataset from the Gaze-Enhanced Smart Classroom for Attention Monitoring (GESCAM), specifically designed for educational settings to train and evaluate our gaze tracking model.
